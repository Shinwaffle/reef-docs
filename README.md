# Official Reef docs

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## About

This is the public repo for my docusaurus instance which hosts the docs for Reef.

Reef is a [homelab](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/) project based off of [this](https://roadmap.sh/devops) roadmap (As of ~July 2024). It intends to combine all of the recommended technologies (with some exceptions like Cloud/Serverless) into one k8s cluster/setup. This repository will have some blog posts, but mostly docs which document my adventure with each service/idea. I hope you find it useful :3

## Why?

I've always wanted to implement something like this for myself, so I thought I might as well document the whole thing so others can get some inspiration/notes for their own project. It is also a personal change in the way I approach installing services on my homelab/pc/anything really. As in, theorize and write about it just so future generations could use it. Enjoy!
